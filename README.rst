Infinite Isopod
---------------

Small little library I use to make using my PostgreSQL wrapper a bit easier.

Currently supported:

- All the actions that ``pg-purepy`` gets you (it's a wrapper)
- Enhanced data row objects
- Loading custom converters automatically

Planned:

- jOOQ-like query building layer (possibly)
